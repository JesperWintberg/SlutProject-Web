                    <h2>  Alex Ovechkin </h2>

                    <p> 
                        My only coworker who follows hockey loves Alex Ovechkin. In fact, he once claimed that Ovechkin was “the world’s greatest human being.”
                        I think he was kidding. But “Ovie” has proven himself a great hockey player. After making his National Hockey League (NHL) debut in 2005 with the Washington Capitals,
                        Ovechkin frequently led the league in scoring, winning the Maurice Richard Trophy, for most goals scored,
                        multiple times (2008–09, 2013–16, 2018–19, 2020). He’s also a three-time recipient of the Hart Memorial Trophy (2008–09, 2013), as the most valuable player in the NHL. He also (finally)
                        won the Stanley Cup with the Capitals in 2018. All that and he has a colorful personality, entertaining fans with amusing quotes (“Russian machine never breaks”) and stunts (wearing a fisherman’s hat during a skill competition at the 2009 All-Star break).
                        Oh, and the coworker? He’s my boss.

                    <h3> Wayne Gretzky </h3>

                    <p>
                        With his finesse and speed, “The Great One” revolutionized the game. Wayne Gretzky shattered long-standing records, notably scoring an unprecedented 894 goals.
                        He also earned four Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers (1984–85, 1987–88) and was named the NHL’s MVP nine (!) times (1980–87, 1989). After being traded to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988,
                        he helped popularize ice hockey in the United States, paving the way for the game’s expansion

                    <h3> Gordie Howe </h3>
                    <img src="/Bilder/Gordie Howe.jpg" alt="Gordie Howe">
                    <p>
                        That’s “Mr. Hockey” to you. Gordie Howe’s 801 career goals set a then record in the NHL, and, as a member of the Red Wings “Production Line,”
                        he won four Stanley Cups (1950, 1952, 1954–55). In addition to being a scorer, “Mr. Elbows” was also known for his gritty play. Not that I’m condoning fisticuffs,
                        but, unlike some players (cough, Gretzky, cough), Howe didn’t need an enforcer to fight his battles. He inspired the “Gordie Howe hat trick,” which was a goal, an assist,
                        and a fight in one game. And Howe played until he was 100. OK, really he was 52, but that’s like 100 in hockey years.
